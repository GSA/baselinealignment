# ICT Baseline Alignment Framework - Test Cases
## Placeholder Index

Until we modify the primary index file, this serves as a placeholder with links to current test case documents.

Test Case documents are organized by Baseline Test (each serving as a Test Scenario or general "functional requirement" for testing), which inculde multiple Test Cases. Will need to develop a Test Scenario template to summarize Test Scenario purpose and subordinate Test Cases
