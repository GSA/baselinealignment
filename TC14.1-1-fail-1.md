title: Link Purpose(In Context) - link has an accessible name/description that is not sufficiently description of the link  (TC14.1-2-fail-1)

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:

# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC14.1-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

  ** Baseline Test ID:** 14.1-LinkPurpose
 
  ** Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample shows that there is a link that does not have an accessible or descriptive name.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1|All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.|
| 14.1-1 | Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | Fail | 
| 14.1-2 | Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from any combination of the link text, accessible name and accessible description, and preceding page context (same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link). [SC 2.4.4] | Fail |
| Result | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. No accessible name or description. | Fail |
