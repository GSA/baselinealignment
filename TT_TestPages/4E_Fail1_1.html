<h2> The History of the Peanut </h2>

<p> 
The peanut probably originated in Peru. It became popular in the United States in the early 1900s after the boll weevil had such a significant impact on the cotton crop in the South. Dr. George Washington Carver, a noted scientist, is credited with finding many uses for the peanut. Another American noted for his work with cereal as a breakfast food, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg is recognized as the inventor of peanut butter in 1895. It was initially used as a protein substitute for older people whose poor teeth could not chew meat. Both peanuts and peanut butter were used as rations in World War I and World War II by United States Armed Forces. It was this use that led to the current popular use of the peanut today in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
