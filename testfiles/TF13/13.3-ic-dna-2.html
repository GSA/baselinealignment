    <p class="big">What is a reasonable accommodation?</p>
    <p>A reasonable accommodation is any change to the application or hiring process, to the job, to the way the job is done, or the work environment that allows a person with a disability who is qualified for the job to perform the essential functions of that job and enjoy equal employment opportunities. Accommodations are considered “reasonable” if they do not create an undue hardship or a direct threat.</p>

    <p class="big">Who is an “individual with a disability?”</p>
    <p>An individual meets the Americans with Disabilities with Act definition act of “disability” that would qualify them for reasonable accommodations if they have “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (sometimes referred to in the regulations as an “actual disability”).” If a disability is not obvious to an employer, they can ask for medical documentation from a health care provider to confirm the need for an accommodation.</p>

    <p>Individuals who solely are “regarded as” having a disability but do not have a disability, are not qualified to receive reasonable accommodations.</p>
