                ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
                All mimsy were the borogoves,
                And the mome raths outgrabe.

                The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
                Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
                The frumious Bandersnatch!”
