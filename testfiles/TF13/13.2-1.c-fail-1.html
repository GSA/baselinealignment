    and Vivaldi.</p>

  espeically brass instruments. Some well-known composers in the Classical period were Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, and Paganini.</p>
  <h5> </h5>
  <p> Music shifted from the elegant compositions of the Classical period to more moodier and passionate pieces in the Romantic period.
  These compositions were emotionally evocative, dramatic, and stirring; for example, numerous pieces were composed for opera and ballet.

  century. Within this time period, the Impressionist and Minimalist periods of art were becoming more widespread, and the music accomodated by becoming
