    Local boards in communities will review applications from local agencies and make recommendations to the National Board on which eligible organizations should be awarded funds. <h4 style="display: inline;">The EFSP National Board will review recommendations</h4> from the local boards and state set-aside committees (acting as local boards), make the final award determinations, and disburse funds directly to the awarded organizations. Funding disbursement to local organizations is expected to begin as soon as a month after the application period is opened, or approximately mid-May 2021.  Most of the funding is anticipated to be awarded to service organizations from southern border states where the greatest needs are expected to be met, but organizations in all states nationwide may apply if they are serving this population of vulnerable people.
