    <p> Classical music in this period was heavily inspired by historical events of conflict and resolution which happened in the beginning of the 20th
    century. Within this time period, the Impressionist and Minimalist periods of art were becoming more widespread, and the music accomodated by becoming
    more abstract. At the end of the time period, technology causes rapid expansion into the possibilities of new forms of music, with the synthesizer becoming more widely used.
    Some famous composers are Satie, Holst, and Stravinsky.</p>
