        <h1>History of the American flag</h1>
        <p>
          The flag of the United States is a symbol of freedom before which Americans recite the pledge of allegiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flag's 13 red and white stripes represent the 13 original colonies. Its 50 white stars on a blue background represent the 50 states.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Each of the colors on the flag has a meaning:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Red: valor and bravery
          </li>
          <li>
            White: purity and innocence
          </li>
          <li>
            Blue: vigilance, perseverance, and justice
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A star is added to the flag when a new state joins the United States. The flag was last modified on July 4, 1960, when Hawaii was incorporated as a state.
