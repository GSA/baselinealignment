            <h1>
                Text of the Declaration of Independence
            </h1>
            <p><strong>In Congress, July 4, 1776</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,</strong> When in the Course
                of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
                connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
                to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
                mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
            <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
                Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
                Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
                powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
                these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,
                laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
                most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
                established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
                shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
                abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
                pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is
                their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
                security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which
                constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great
                Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
                of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
            <div class="padding-left">
                <p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>

                <p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in
                    their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected
                    to attend to them.</p>

                <p>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
                    people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them
                    and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

                <p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
                    depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
                    measures.</p>

                <p>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on
                    the rights of the people.</p>

                <p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the
                    Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their
                    exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without,
                    and convulsions within.</p>

                <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws
                    for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and
                    raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>

                <p>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing
                    Judiciary powers.</p>

                <p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and
                    payment of their salaries.</p>

                <p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people,
                    and eat out their substance.</p>

                <p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>

                <p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>

                <p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and
                    unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>

                <p>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

                <p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the
                    Inhabitants of these States:</p>

                <p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

                <p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

                <p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

                <p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences</p>

                <p>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an
                    Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit
                    instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>

                <p>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms
                    of our Governments:</p>

                <p>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us
                    in all cases whatsoever.</p>

                <p>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
                </p>

                <p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
                    people.</p>

                <p>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
                    desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely
                    paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>

                <p>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their
                    Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their
                    Hands.</p>

                <p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of
                    our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished
                    destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated
                Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every
                act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
            <p>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of
                attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of
                the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and
                magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations,
                which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the
                voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces
                our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled,
                appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by
                Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies
                are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to
                the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and
                ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy
                War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which
                Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
                protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred
                Honor.</p>
