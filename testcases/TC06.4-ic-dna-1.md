# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 'Images of Text - DNA: no images of text'


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.4-ic-dna-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The code sample presents a page with no images of text. A successful test should identify that Baseline Test 6.4 Images of Text Does Not Apply (DNA).

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [6.4 Test Procedure for Images of Text](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/06Images/#64-test-procedure-for-images-of-text)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.4-ImageText
    
    **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: DNA since there are no images of text on the page.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
