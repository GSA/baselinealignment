    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. Determine if the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute is correct for the language for the page. The value must also be identified in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's IANA Language subtag registry.

    The code sample provides a page in English with the language correctly identified. A successful test should identify a PASS for Baseline 15.1-LanguagePage.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 15.1-LanguagePage
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The page's <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag has <code>lang="en"</code> correctly identified.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives).| Applicable; page has text. |
| **15.1-1** | Identify the default human language of the page by reviewing the page content. The default human language of the page is the language in which most of the content is presented. | Page language is English. | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the `lang` attribute is defined on the `<html>` tag for the page. [SC 3.1.1] | Pass: `<html lang="en">` |
| **15.1-3** | Check that the value of the `lang` attribute matches the determined default human language for the page. [SC 3.1.1] | Pass: "en" is the correct language subtag for English |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | All checks PASS. |
