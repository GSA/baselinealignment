| **13.2-IC** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | No visually apparent headings found. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | Does Not Apply |
