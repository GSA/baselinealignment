| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | DNA: Observe for changes to content. There are no interactive elements or time-delayed notifications on the page that would trigger a change to content. |
