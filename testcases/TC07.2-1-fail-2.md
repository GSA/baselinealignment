| 1-a | Check that the instructions contain additional information that allows it to be located, identified, and understood without any knowledge of its shape, size, or relative position | Fail. There is no on-screen alternative text to describe the meaning conveyed by the size. |
| 1-b | Check that any auditory cues also provide programmatically determinable visual and/or textual cues.| DNA. No auditory cues. |
