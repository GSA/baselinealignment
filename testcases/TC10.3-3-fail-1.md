# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: On Input - form submitted unexpectedly after exiting form field

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.3-3-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    The page has two textbox form elements.

    When focus is moved away from the second textbox, a message appears saying that the the form has been submitted.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 10.3 On Input.

| IC-1 | Identify the elements on the page. Enter input into the elements. Move focus away from the elements. Observe for context changes. | There are text boxes on the page. |
| 1 | Enter data in all form fields, and exit (tab out of) the field. | Enter data and tab out of or click away from each field. |
| 2 | Change selections and/or values for form components, such as radio buttons, check boxes, select lists, etc. | Change value in the text boxes. |
| 3 | Check that navigating away from a component and/or changing component values/selections (e.g., entering data in a text field, changing a radio button selection) does NOT initiate a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component. `[`SC 3.2.2`]` Examples of a change of context could include: Forms submitted automatically when exiting the field, Forms submitted automatically when exiting the last field in a form, New windows launched when changing a radio button selection, Focus is changed to another component when a select list item is selected | Fail: Tabbing out of or clicking away from the second form field causes a message to appear which states that the form has been submitted. |
