# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Language of Page - lang attribute on wrong tag


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC15.1-2-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute for the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. 

    The code sample provides a page in English with no <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. Instead, the <code>lang</code> attribute is on the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. A successful test should identify a FAIL for Baseline 15.1-LanguagePage.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 15.1-LanguagePage
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The English page's <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag has no <code>lang</code> attribute. The <code>lang</code> attribute is on the a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, which is incorrect.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives).| Applicable; page has text. |
| **15.1-1** | Identify the default human language of the page by reviewing the page content. The default human language of the page is the language in which most of the content is presented. | Page language is English. | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the lang attribute is defined on the `<html>` tag for the page. [SC 3.1.1] | Fail: `<html>` has no `lang` attribute |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | Fail: 15.1-2 fails |
