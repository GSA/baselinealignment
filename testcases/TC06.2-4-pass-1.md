# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - empty accessible name or description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-4-pass-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in a <code>alt=""</code> attribute, which would cause Assistive Technologies to ignore the image. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. |
| | Check that at least one of the following is true [SC 1.1.1]: | |
| **6.2-1** | The ARIA role is "presentation". | False |
| **6.2-2** | The ARIA role is "none". | False |
| **6.2-3** | Check to see that the aria-hidden is set to "true".| False |
| **6.2-4** | Check to see that the text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) is empty. | True |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.2-DecorativeImage fails. | PASS; the fourth check passed. |
