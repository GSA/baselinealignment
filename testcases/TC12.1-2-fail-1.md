# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Adding the ARIA `role="presentation"` to a `<table>` element instructs assistive technologies to ignore the table's structural semantics (i.e., the table's header and data cell relationships). Data tables require the programmatic, table structure semantics to properly understand the relationships between table headers and data cells. Therefore, if a `<table>` element also includes `role="presentation"` then it fails to provide sufficient programmatic information to assistive technology users to properly navigate and fully understand the data.

    The code sample provides includes a `<table>` element that also includes `role="presentation"`. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 12.1 because the table DOES NOT provide sufficient programmatic information about the table header and data cell relationships.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 12.1-DataTable
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Because the `<table>` element includes an ARIA `role="presentation"`, assistive technologies do not have access to the table header header and data cell relationships necessary for understanding the data in the table. The table fails Baseline test 12.1 because of inadequately defined programmatic relationships in the table.

| **IC-1** | All content/data visually presented in a table with column and/or row headers where the content is not in a meaningful sequence when linearized. Note: Linearization of table content is the presentation of a table’s two-dimensional content in one-dimensional order of the content in the source, beginning with the first cell in the first row and ending with the last cell in the last row, from left to right, top to bottom. | One `<table>` exists in the test data code sample. The table is a data table; understanding the data in the table requires understanding the table header and data cell relationships. Linearizing would distort the meaning of the information/data compared to the visual presentation. |
| **12.1-1** | Table: Check that each data table has programmatic markup to identify it as a table using one of the following techniques [SC 1.3.1]: HTML <table>; ARIA role="table"' ARIA role="grid" | Pass: The data is contained in a `<table>` element. |
| **12.1-2** | Check that the data <table> element DOES NOT have role="presentation" or role="none". [SC 1.3.1] | Fail: The `<table>` also includes `role="presentation"`. |
| **Result** | If any of the above tests fail, Baseline Test 12.1-DataTable fails. | 12.1-2 check fails; therefore Baseline 12.1 fails. |
