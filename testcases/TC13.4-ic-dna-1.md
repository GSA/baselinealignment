# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: No visually apparent list


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.4-ic-dna-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent lists must also provide indication programatically that the informaton is included in a list. In the code sample there is no visually apparent list. 

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    [13.4 Test Procedure for Visually Apparent Lists](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/13Structure/#134-test-procedure-for-visually-apparent-lists)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.4-List

    **Test Instruction:** ic

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Because the information presented visually in a list is not defined as a list programatically the content fails baseline test 13.4.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers:

# Include the table in the content section below

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent lists. For each list, determine if it appears to be ordered, unordered, or a description list. Ordered lists `<ol>` are numbered sequentially and, if necessary, hierarchically (e.g., 1, 2, 2a, 2ai, etc.) and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is important. Unordered lists `<ul>` are not numbered and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is not important. Description lists `<dl>` are used to group terms with their descriptions. | DNA - no visually apparent list |
