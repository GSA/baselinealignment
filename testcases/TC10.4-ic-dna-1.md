# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Identification - no automatic error detection/notification

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.4-ic-dna-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page contains a textbox, a label for the textbox, and a button.

    When the user enters text into the textbox and presses the button, nothing happens. No validation is performed and no alert notification appears.

    10.4 Error Identification does not apply (DNA).

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [10.4 Test Procedure for Error Identification](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#104-test-procedure-for-error-identification)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.4-ErrorIdentification

    **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 3.3.1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: 10.4 does not apply because when incorrect values are entered/submitted, no alert notification are provided.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1 | Input form components with automatic error detection and notification. | Identifiy that there are form components with automatic error detection and notification. |
| 1 | Enter incorrect values in input form components in order to trigger automatic error detection that results in error notifications. Examples include but are not limited to: required fields, date (format), state (abbreviations in an address), password | DNA: Entering incorrect values does not result in alert notification. |
