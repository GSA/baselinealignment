# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Identification - insufficient notification of error

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.4-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a textbox labeled "Enter A Number" and a submit button.

    When a non-numeric value is entered into the textbox and the user shifts focus away from the textbox or presses the submit button, then an error notification is displayed at the top of the screen.

    The error notification is not contained in a live region and focus is not shifted to the error notification.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 10.4 Error Identification.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [10.4 Test Procedure for Error Identification](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#104-test-procedure-for-error-identification)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.4-ErrorIdentification

    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The user is not made aware of the error when focus is shifted away from the item in error or when trying to submit the form.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| IC-1 | Input form components with automatic error detection and notification. | Identifiy that there are form components with automatic error detection and notification. |
| 1 | Enter incorrect values in input form components in order to trigger automatic error detection that results in error notifications. Examples include but are not limited to: required fields, date (format), state (abbreviations in an address), password | Pass: Entering incorrect values results in error notifications. |
| 2 | If an input error is automatically detected, check that the error notification meets all of the following [SC 3.3.1]: The user is made aware of the error (whether immediately upon shifting focus away from the item in error or when trying to submit the form), and the error is described to the user in text, and the item that is in error is identified in text. | Fail: The user is not made aware of the error immediately upon shifting focus away from the item in error or when trying to submit the form. |
