    Detect existence of captions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data does not include any captions. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded.

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.4-1** | Enable captions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with captions is provided, test that file. | No Result |
| **17.4-2** | Check that captions are provided. **Update to Baseline required to insert this instruction**| Fail |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | 6.1-2 check fails. |
