# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.4-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    Detect existence of captions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data does not include any captions. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The video in the code sample does not provide any captions.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.4-1** | Enable captions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with captions is provided, test that file. | Captions enabled |
| **17.4-2** | Check that captions are provided. **Update to Baseline required to insert this instruction**| Fail |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded fails. | 17.4-2 check fails. |
