# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Image - text equivalent in alt attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image. Then determine whether the text alternative output for the image provides an equivalent description of the image.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an ALT attribute. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6. Images.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.1-MeaningfulImage
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample provides an ALT attribute with a value that provides an equivalent text alternative description of the image.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.) | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1-1** | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. [SC 1.1.1] | The text alternative is not empty (`alt='Bland Corp. logo'`.) |
| **6.1-2** | Check that the non-empty text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) provides an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. Refer to HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img. [SC 1.1.1] | The text alternative "Bland Corp. logo" provides an equivalent description |
| **6.1-2.a** | 
| **6.1-2.b** | 
| **6.1-3** |
| **6.1-4** |
| **6.1-5** | 
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | All checks PASS so the code sample passes Baseline 6.1 Test Procedure for Meaningful Images. |
