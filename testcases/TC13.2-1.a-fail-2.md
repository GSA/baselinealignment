# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - heading levels do not matching visual hierarchy

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.a-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

    The code sample provides visual headings that appear to be at three levels. Programmatically, the third level headings are &lt;h3&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; with style attributes that set all of them to the same font size to make them appear to be at the same level. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **13.2-IC** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | Visual apparent headings found. |
| **13.2-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]: | |
| **13.2-1.a** | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code><h1></code> is a higher level than <code><h2></code>, which is higher than <code><h3></code>. | Fail: the visual headings are programmatically determinable, but the programmatic heading levels do not match the visual heading presentation. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1 fails |
