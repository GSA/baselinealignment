# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - with image inserted via CSS


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-5-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image being inserted by CSS, which would cause Assistive Technologies to ignore the image. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.2-DecorativeImage

    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys decoration | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is pure decoration. |
| | Check that at least one of the following is true [SC 1.1.1]: | |
| **6.2-1** | The ARIA role is "presentation". | False |
| **6.2-2** | The ARIA role is "none". | False |
| **6.2-3** | Check to see that the aria-hidden is set to "true".| False |
| **6.2-4** | Check to see that the text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) is empty. | False |
| **6.2-5** | Check to see that the image is inserted via CSS. | True |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.2-DecorativeImage fails. | PASS; the fifth check passed. |
