# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Text with contrast ratio greater than 4.5:1

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC08.1-2-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample provides sufficient contrast between the foreground and background.


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-Contrast

  **Test Instruction:** All


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample provides sufficient contrast based on the text size, foreground color, and background color.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC | All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | There are multiple paragraphs of text on the page. |
| 8.1-1 | Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | The contrast ratio for all of the text on the page is at least 4.5:1 or greater. | 
| 8.1-2 | Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 1.4.3] | The contrast ratio for all of the text on the page is at least 4.5:1 or greater. |
| Results | If both of the above checks pass, then Baseline Test 8.1-ContrastMinimum fails. | Pass |
