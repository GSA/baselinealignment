# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 3:1 contrast ratio for 18 point font

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC8.1-3-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample is sufficient contrast between the foreground and background.


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline: | 
  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum]https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/08Contrast.html#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-Contrast
    
  **Test Instruction:** 1


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample provide sufficient contrast based on the text size, foreground color, and background color.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
|IC| All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above)|
| 8.1-1| Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | The contrast ratio for the text is 3:1.| 
| 8.1-2| Check that the contrast ratio is at least 3:1. [SC 3.14] | The contrast ratio is more than 3:1 (it is 3.8:1) |
| Results | Both of the above checks pass, then Baseline Test 8.1-Contrast Minimum.     |Pass|
