# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: On Input - no form components

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.3-ic-dna-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    The page has a single level 2 heading and no form components.

    A successful test should identify a DNA against Baseline 10.3 On Input.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: |
    [10.3 Test Procedure for On Input](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#103-test-procedure-for-on-input)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.3-OnInput

    **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: There are no form elements, therefore there is nothing to input.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF10/10.3-ic-dna-1.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers:
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result
#
# Include the table in the content section below
