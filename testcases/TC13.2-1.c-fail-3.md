# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - multiple visual headings with element levels AND role=heading BUT aria-level is not defined


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.c-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visual headings are assigned programmatic heading structure by HTML element tag <code><h#></code> and by ARIA attributes <code>role="heading"</code> but <code>h1</code> does not have <code>aria-level="#"</code>. If using HTML and ARIA together, the HTML level and aria level must match.

    The code sample provides matched heading levels for all except <code>h1</code>. When an <code>aria-level</code> is not defined, then level 2 is the default level, which creates a level conflict with the <code>h1</code> heading. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.2-VisHeadingProg

    **Test Instruction:** 1.c

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The "Types of Music" heading in the code sample has  mismatched heading levels (HTML heading level is "1". ARIA heading level is not specified and defaults to "2".)


# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

# Include the table in the content section below

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | Visual headings found. |
| **13.2-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. |  | 
| **13.2-1.a** | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code><h1></code> is a higher level than <code><h2></code>, which is higher than <code><h3></code>. | Pass: The visual <code><h1></code> heading is higher than the visual <code><h2></code> heading, which is higher than the <code><h3></code> headings. |
| **13.2-1.b** | Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section.  | Pass: the visual hierarchy of the headings is correct |
| **13.2-1.c** | HTML or ARIA programmatically identify each heading. When both are used, heading levels must match. H42: each heading is marked with <code><h1></code> to <code><h6></code>. ARIA12: each heading is marked with <code>role="heading"</code> and <code>aria-level="#"</code>. The default heading level is "2" when none is specified. | Fail: The "Types of Music" heading has mismatched heading levels. HTML heading level is 1. ARIA heading level defaults to 2. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.c fails |
