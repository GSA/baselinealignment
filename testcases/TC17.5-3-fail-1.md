# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Audio Description (Prerecorded) - audio descriptions do not adequately describe important visual content


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.5-3-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of audio descriptions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data includes inaccurate audio descriptions. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 17.5-ADPrerecorded.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.5-ADPrerecorded
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The video in the code sample has inaccurate audio description.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.5-1** | Enable audio descriptions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with audio descriptions is provided, test that file. | No result |
| **17.5-2** | Check that audio descriptions are provided **(Baseline update required to insert this instruction.)** | Pass |
| **17.5-3** | Check that the audio (with audio descriptions enabled) adequately describes important visual content in the media, including information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content. [SC 1.2.5] | Fail, wrong application identified |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 17.5-ADPrerecorded fails. | FAIL |
