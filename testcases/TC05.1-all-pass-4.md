| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Activate the select box by selecting an option. Observe for changes to content. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: The label of the select box describes that screen content will change upon making a selection. |
| 2 | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` | Pass: The combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. |
