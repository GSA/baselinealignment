# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - notification of changed content via other programmatic means

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-all-pass-4

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a select box dropdown with an associated label. The label describes that content will be changed upon making a selection.

    Upon making a selection, text content appears on screen.

    A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    [5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/05Changing.html#51-test-procedure-for-changes-in-content)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 5.1-ChangeContent

    **Test Instruction:** all

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After content change, notification of the changed content is provided via other programmatic means (the label of the select box)

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF05/05.1-all-pass-4.html

| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Activate the select box by selecting an option. Observe for changes to content. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: The label of the select box describes that screen content will change upon making a selection. |
| 2 | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` | Pass: The combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. |
