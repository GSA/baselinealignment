| **IC-1** | Visually apparent lists. For each list, determine if it appears to be ordered, unordered, or a description list. Ordered lists `<ol>` are numbered sequentially and, if necessary, hierarchically (e.g., 1, 2, 2a, 2ai, etc.) and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is important. Unordered lists `<ul>` are not numbered and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is not important. Description lists `<dl>` are used to group terms with their descriptions. | This code sample includes one visually apparent description list. | 
| **13.4-3** | Check that content is marked as a description list when terms and their descriptions are presented in the form of a list. [SC 1.3.1] | Fail - the visually apparent description list is not defined programatically. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, Baseline Test 13.4-List fails. | FAIL; the check fails. |
