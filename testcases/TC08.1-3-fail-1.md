# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Insufficient contrast ratio for 15 point, bolded text

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC08.1-3-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample is NOT sufficient contrast between the foreground and background for bolded text.


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline: | 
  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-Contrast

  **Test Instruction:** 3


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Although he foreground text in the code sample is bolded, it DOES NOT provide sufficient contrast because the contrast is below the 3:1 contrast ratio requirement for bolded text.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
|IC | All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | One paragraph of text is present in the code sample. |
| 8.1-1 | Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | The contrast ratio for the text is 2.86:1. | 
| 8.1-2 | Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 1.4.3] | The contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1. |
| 8.1-3 | If the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1, check that the ratio is at least 3:1 AND the font meets one of the following criteria: [SC 1.4.3] | The contrast ratio is less than 3:1 (it is 2.86:1) |
| Results | If both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-ContrastMinimum fails. | Fail |
