title: Media Player Audio Description Control Level - no synchronized media on page


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1

    Detect existence of synchronized media player.

    The code sample does not contain synchronized media player. A successful test should identify a Does Not Apply for Baseline 17.3-MediaPlayerADLevel.
