# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - aria-live='off'


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The aria-live politeness setting is used to set the priority with which screen readers should announce updates to designated live regions. The options are off, polite and assertive. With the exceptions of the ARIA roles of alert, log, and status (with default option settings of assertive, polite, and polite respectively), the default aria-live option is off. For any live region meant to convey meaningful information to assistive technology, the off setting, being the same as the omission of the live region altogether, would represent a failure of accessibility. 
    
    The code sample presents <code>aria-live='off'</code>. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 5.1-ChangeContent.

    [5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/05Changing/#51-test-procedure-for-changes-in-content)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 5.1-ChangeContent
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After content change, the text updated  in the code sample is neither programmatically bound, given focus, nor included in a live region.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
