# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 'Sensory Characteristics - DNA: no Sensory Characteristics'


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC07.2-ic-dna-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The code sample presents a page with no instructions that rely on Sensory Characteristics. A successful test should identify that Baseline Test 7.2 Sensory Characteristics Does Not Apply (DNA).

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [7.2 Test Procedure for Sensory Characteristics](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/07Sensory/#72-test-procedure-for-sensory-characteristics)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 7.2-SensoryCharacteristics
    
    **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: DNA since there are no instructions that rely on Sensory Characteristics.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
