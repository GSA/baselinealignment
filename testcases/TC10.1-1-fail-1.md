# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Form Names - no accessible name or description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.1-1-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the input element. 
    
    The code sample data does not include attributes that contribute to accessible name or accessible description output. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline Test 10.1 FormName.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    [10.1 Test Procedure for Form Names](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#101-test-procedure-for-form-names)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.1-FormName
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 4.1.2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The <code>input</code> element in the code sample does not have any attributes that would contribute to an accessible name or description.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, read-only fields, and multi-select lists. | `Input` text field |
| **IC-2** | Find all instructions and cues (textual and graphical) that are related to form components, including groupings, order of completion, special conditions or qualifiers, format instructions, etc. | "First name" visually labels the input field. |
| **10.1-1** | Check that the combination of the accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | Fail: Accessible name and accessible description are both empty. | 
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 10.1-FormName fails. | 10.1-1 check fails. |
