# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Keyboard access - individual keystrokes require specific timing

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC1.1-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: Determine the functionality of visible and hidden interactive interface components (links, form fields, drop down menus, show/hide content, tree views, pop ups/light boxes, iframes, etc.) available using a mouse (hover and/or click). Check that individual keystrokes do not require specific timings for activation.

The code sample includes a requirement to press and hold a key. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 1. Keyboard Accessible.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: 
    [1.1 Test Procedure for Keyboard Access](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/01Keyboard.html#11-test-procedure-for-keyboard-access)
    
    **Baseline Test ID:** 1.1-KeyboardAccess
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: > Users must press and hold a key for three seconds to use a function.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **1C** | Determine the functionality of visible and hidden interactive interface components (links, form fields, drop down menus, show/hide content, tree views, pop ups/light boxes, iframes, etc.) available using a mouse (hover and/or click). If operation requires specific timings of individual keystrokes, check if another control is provided on the page with the same functionality which does not require specific timings for operation. (All functionality must be available without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes to operate.)| Two form fields and two buttons are accessible via mouse. There is no alternative control. | 
| **1.1-2a** | Check that individual keystrokes do not require specific timings for activation. | Fail: changing the Request Password Reset button to Request User Name requires the user to hold the spacebar for three seconds. |
| **1.1-2b** | 	If 1.1-2a fails, check whether the failed functionality is available through another control on the page with the same functionality that does not require specific timings for operation. | Fail: there is no alternative control that does not require specific timings for operation. |
| **Result** | If 1.1-2b fails, then Baseline Test 1.1-Keyboard Access fails. | 1.1-2b check fails. |
