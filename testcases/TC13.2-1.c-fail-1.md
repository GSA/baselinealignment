# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - visual heading not defined programmatically

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.c-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent heading is not a programmatic heading.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    [13.2 Test Procedure for Visual Headings](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/13Structure/#132-test-procedure-for-visual-headings-programmatic)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.2-VisHeadingProg

    **Test Instruction:** 1.c

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The "Classical Period" heading in the code sample is not defined as a heading programmatically.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF13/13.2-1.c-fail-1.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers:
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result
#
# Include the table in the content section below

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | Visual apparent headings found. |
| **13.2-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. |  | 
| **13.2-1.a** | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code><h1></code> is a higher level than <code><h2></code>, which is higher than <code><h3></code>. | Pass: The <code><h1></code> heading is higher than the other <code><h2></code> headings. |
| **13.2-1.b** | Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section.  | Pass: the visual hierarchy of the headings are correct |
| **13.2-1.c** | HTML or ARIA programmatically identify each heading. When both are used, heading levels must match. H42: each heading is marked with <code><h1></code> to <code><h6></code>. ARIA12: each heading is marked with <code>role="heading"</code> and <code>aria-level="#"</code>. The default heading level is "2" when none is specified. | Fail: a visual heading is not programmatically identified with HTML or ARIA |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.c fails |
