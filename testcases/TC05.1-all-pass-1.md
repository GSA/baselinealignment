# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - notification of changed content in alert dialog

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-all-pass-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a data table with three columns. Column 1 is the product name, column 2 is the stock count, column three contains delete buttons.

    Pressing a delete button removes the row that contains the delete button and its associated data. After the row is removed from screen, an alert notification appears telling the user which row was deleted.

    A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Identify the elements on the page and locate the buttons within the table. Activate a delete button and observe for content changes. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: An alert dialog appears notifying the user of the changed content. |
| 2 | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` | Pass: The change that occurs is that content is remove from screen. Therefore, the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content does not apply. |
