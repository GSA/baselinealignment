# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - with visual heading defined programmatically using heading elements, but role=heading is used AND aria-level does not match heading element level



# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.c-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

    The code sample provides a visual heading defined programmatically using heading elements, but <code> role=heading </code> is used and the aria-level does not match the heading element level. This would cause assistive technologies confusion because of the inconsistency between <code> role=heading </code> and the mismatch of aria-level to the heading element level. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. |
| **13.2-1.a** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code> <h1 </code> is a higher level than <code> <h2> </code>, which is higher than <code> <h3> </code>| Fail: the headings do not have the correct visual priority levels. |
| **13.2-1.b** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. Check that headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. | Fail; the subheadings of an equal or higher level do not start new sections.
| **13.2-1.c-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. Check to see that the headings in the code sample are defined programmatically. | Fail: the headings are not defined programmatically
| **13.2-1.c-2** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. HTML or ARIA programmatically identify each heading. When both are used, heading levels must match. | Fail: the heading levels do not match
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.c-2 fails |
