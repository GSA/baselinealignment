    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image. Then determine whether the text alternative output for the image provides an equivalent description of the image.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an ALT attribute. However, because it includes <code>role="presentation"</code>, Assistive Technologies should ignore the presence of the image. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 6. Images because the meaningful image DOES NOT provide an equivalent text description.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.1-MeaningfulImage
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample provides an ALT attribute with a value that provides an equivalent text alternative description of the image. However, the image also includes <code>role="presentation"</code>, which would prompt Assistive Technologies to ignore the image and its text alternative description.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.) | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1-1** | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's non-empty accessible name from `alt` is "Bland Corp. logo". | 
| **6.1-2** | Check that the non-empty text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) provides an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. Refer to HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's accessible name "Bland Corp. logo" is an equivalent description. |
| **6.1-2a** | Descriptions of the image that are provided by page content must be programmatically associated. | Not applicable |
| **6.1-2b** | When an image is updated to convey a new meaning, check that its text alternative is updated at the same time. [SCs 1.1.1 and 4.1.2] | Not applicable  |
| **6.1-3** | Check that the ARIA role is NOT "presentation".| Fail |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | 6.1-3 check fails. |
