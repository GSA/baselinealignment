# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Link Purpose (In Context) - Link does not sufficiently describe its purpose

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC14.1-2-fail-1
# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
  Detect the existence of a `<link>` element and determine if the link text sufficiently describes of its purpose. The code sample includes a link that does adequately describe the link's purpose. A successful test should identify a Fail for Baseline 14.1-LinkPurpose.

  **Baseline Test ID:** 14.1-LinkPurpose
 
  **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: A link in the code sample does not sufficiently describe the purpose of the link.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1|All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.| The sample code includes multiple links on the page. |
| 14.1-1 | Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | Pass - each of the links has a non-empty accessible name and description. |
| 14.1-2 | Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from any combination of the link text, accessible name and accessible description, and preceding page context (same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link). [SC 2.4.4] | Fail - a link provides an accessible name and description that does not sufficiently describe the link's purpose.  |
| Result | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. | Fail - one of the checks fails. |
