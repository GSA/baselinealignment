# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Language of Parts - not identified


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC15.2-2-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute for text (part) that differs from the default human language of the page. 

    The code sample provides a page in English with a part in French, with the no language identified for the French part. A successful test should identify a FAIL for Baseline 15.2-LanguagePart.

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The French part has no <code>lang</code> attribute.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Text content that differs from the default human language of the page including alternative text for non-text content.| Applicable; page has French text on an English page. |
| **15.2-1** | Identify the human language of the text content that differs from the default human language of the page. | French | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the `lang` attribute is specified for any HTML element that contains a content segment that differs from the default human language of the page. [SC 3.1.2] | Fail: French part's `<blockquote>` has no `lang` attribute |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | Fail: 15.1-2 fails. |
