# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Programmatic Heading - non-visual heading has heading structure

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.3-1-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Programmatic headings should only be used on visual headings, which denote sections of content. 

    The code sample provides a programmatic heading on content that is not a visual heading and within a paragraph. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.3-ProgHeadingVisual.

| **IC-1** | Programmatically determined headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>` or ARIA `role="heading"`. | `<h4>` found|
| **13.3-1** | Check that each programmatically determinable heading is also serving as a visual heading on the page. Content that is not a visual heading cannot have a role of heading. [SC 1.3.1] | There is a `<h4>` within a paragraph of text. It is not a visual heading.|
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.3-ProgHeadingVisual fails. | FAIL |
