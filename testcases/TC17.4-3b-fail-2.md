# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Captions (Prerecorded) - inaccurate captions


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.4-2.b-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of accurate captions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data include any captions that are not accurate. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3.b

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The video in the code sample has inaccurate captions.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.4-1** | Enable captions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with captions is provided, test that file. | Captions enabled |
| **17.4-2** | Check that captions are provided. **Update to Baseline required to insert this instruction**| Pass |
| **17.4-3** | Check that captions are accurate and include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location. [SC 1.2.2] | Fail due to 3b. |
| **17.4-3a** | Listen to the audio of the entire synchronized media. | No result |
| **17.4-3b** | Compare the audio to the captions for accuracy, time-synchronization, and equivalence. | Fail; captions are not accurate. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded fails. | 17.4-3b check fails. |
