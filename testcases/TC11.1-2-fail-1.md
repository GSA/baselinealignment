    The `<title>` element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. This test evaluates the accuracy of the <title> element on the Web page.

    The code sample presents a page with an inaccurate `<title>` element. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled.

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: An inaccurate `<title>` element is defined for the page.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
