    The `<title>` element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. This test evaluates the accuracy of the <title> element on the Web page.

    The code sample presents a page with an inaccurate `<title>` element. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 11.1 Test Procedure for Page Titled
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: An inaccurate <title> element is defined for the page.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives) and a `<title>` element (note: proposed change to baseline).| Applicable; page is an HTML web page with text and a `<title>` element. |
| **11.1** | Check that a page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined for the page. `[SC 2.4.2`] | Pass: <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined | 
| **11.2** | Check that the Page Title identifies the contents or purpose of the Web page. `[SC 2.4.2`] | Fail: the Page Title does not identify the contents or purpose of the Web page. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled fails. | 11.1-2 check fails |
