# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Page Titles - has correct descriptive <title> element


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC11.1-all-pass-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. This test evaluates the presence of the <title> element on the Web page.

    The code sample presents a page with a <title> element that correctly describes the page content/purpose. A successful test should identify a pass against Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives) (note: proposed change to baseline).| Applicable; page is an HTML web page with text. |
| **11.1** | Check that a page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined for the page. `[SC 2.4.2`] | Pass:  <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined | 
| **11.2** | Check that the Page Title identifies the contents or purpose of the Web page. `[SC 2.4.2`] | Pass: the Page Title correctly identifies the contents or purpose of the Web page. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled fails. | 11.1-2 check passes |
