# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - value not accurate after change

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-2-fail-4

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    This page has a non-native horizontal slider control.

    When the slider is moved, the numeric value changes on screen. However, assistive technologies cannot programmatically determine the value of the slider after it is changed because the <code>aria-valuenow</code> attribute is not updated to match the value displayed on screen.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/05Changing/#51-test-procedure-for-changes-in-content)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 5.1-ChangeContent

    **Test Instruction:** 2.d

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After content change, the programmatically determined value of the element does not change.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Move the slider using the mouse or keyboard arrow keys and observe for changes to content. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: Focus does not shift from the element that changed. |
| 2.d | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Value: the value is updated after a change, if applicable. | Fail: The programmatically determinable value of the slider does not change to match the visually displayed value |
