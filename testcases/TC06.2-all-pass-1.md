# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - decorative image on webpage


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. Check if the aria role is "none", "presentation", the aria-hidden is set to true,
    the text alternative is empty, or if the image is inserted with CSS.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an <code>aria-label</code> attribute. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.2-DecorativeImage

    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample is a decorative image from its <code>aria-label</code> attribute.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys decoration | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |

| **6.2-1** | Descriptions of the image that are provided by page content must be programmatically associated. | Not applicable |
| **6.2-2** | Check to see if the image was inserted with CSS | Pass |
| **6.2-3** | Check that the ARIA role is "presentation".| Pass |
| **6.2-4** | Check that the ARIA role is "none". | Pass |
| **6.2-5** | Check that aria-hidden is set to "true". | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.2-DecorativeImage fails. | All checks PASS (or do not apply). |
