# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: `<div>` element has `role="cell"` but is inside another set of `<div>` elements that use `role="row"` and `role="grid"` respectively

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC12.1-3-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
Using ARIA table semantics that overlap can create confusion and conflict for both browser and assistive technologies. When a 'role="cell"' is added to a `<div>` element that is inside another set of `<div>` elements that use `role="row"` and `role="grid"`, then it could create conflict. Table in the sample code includes a data cell that also defines an ARIA role that overlaps structural semantics.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [12.1 Test Procedure for Data Tables](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/12DataTables/#12-tables)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 12.1-DataTable
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: | 
The table fails the baseline test because a `<div>` element has `role="cell"` and is inside another set of `<div>` elements that use `role = "cell"` and `role="grid"` respectively.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder

| **IC-1** | All content/data visually presented in a table with column and/or row headers where the content is not in a meaningful sequence when linearized. (Note: Linearization of table content is the presentation of a tableâ€™s two-dimensional content in one-dimensional order of the content in the source, beginning with the first cell in the first row and ending with the last cell in the last row, from left to right, top to bottom.) | One `<table>` exists in the test data code sample. The table is a data table; understanding the data in the table requires understanding the table header and data cell relationships. Linearizing would distort the meaning of the information/data compared to the visual presentation.|
| **12.1-1** | Table: Table data cell: Check that each data cell uses only one of the following methods to identify it as a data cell within a table row depending on the technique identified in the first step [SC 1.3.1]:
For HTML `<table>`: `<td>` for the cell, which must be within a `<tr>` row.
For ARIA `role="table"`: ARIA `role="cell"`, which must be within an ARIA `role="row"`.
For ARIA `role="grid"`: ARIA `role="gridcell"`, which must be within an ARIA `role="row"` (if the ARIA grid is not making use of the native HTML `<table>` element and structure). | Pass: The table is contained in a `<table>` element. | 
| **12.1-2** | For ARIA `role="table"` check that ARIA `role="cell"` is within an ARIA `role="row"`. [SC 1.3.1] | Fail: The ARIA `role="cell"` is NOT within an ARIA `role="row"`. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 12.1-DataTable fails. | 12.1-3 check fails. |
