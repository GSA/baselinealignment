# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Prevention - form that results in a financial transaction is reversible

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.7-2.a-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a form which contains two select boxes, and a submit button.

    Changing the selection in the select boxes causes no screen change and triggers no validation. When the submit button is pressed, the form disappears, a confirmation notification appears and receives focus. A button appears below the confirmation which offers the opportunity to reverse the transaction.

    The system did not give the user a mechanism to review, confirm, or correct information before the submission. The system does not provide an opportunity to correct input errors. However, the system does provide a way to reverse the submission.

    A successful test should identify a Pass against Baseline 10.7 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict

result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
