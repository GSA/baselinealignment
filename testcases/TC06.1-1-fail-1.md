# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Image - no accessible name or description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image.

    The code sample data input does not include any attributes that would contribute to accessible name or accessible description output. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 6. Images.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [6.1 Test Procedure for Meaningful Images](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/06Images.html#61-test-procedure-for-meaningful-images)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.1-MeaningfulImage
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample does not provide any attributes that would contribute to an accessible name or description text alternative output.

# URL for the code sample
# Upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder, then provide the link

| **IC-1** |  Identify any `<img>` elements. | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. |
| **IC-1** | Determine whether the image is meaningful. Review the page content and image context to determine whether the image conveys meaningful information. | The image is meaningful, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1** | Calculate the accessible name and accessible description output for the image according to [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element). | The output for the accessible name and accessible description computations is `empty`. |
| **Result** | Determine whether any checks fail according to the `6. Images` test instructions. | The first check fails due to empty accessible name and/or description in the text alternative computation output. |
