# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Image - no accessible name or description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image.

    The code sample data input does not include any attributes that would contribute to accessible name or accessible description output. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 6. Images.

    [6.1 Test Procedure for Meaningful Images](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/06Images.html#61-test-procedure-for-meaningful-images)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.1-MeaningfulImage
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample does not provide any attributes that would contribute to an accessible name or description text alternative output.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.) | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1-1** | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. [SC 1.1.1] | Fail: The output for the accessible name and accessible description computation is empty. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | 6.1-1 check fails. |
