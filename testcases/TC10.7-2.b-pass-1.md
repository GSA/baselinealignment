# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Prevention - form that adds user-controllable data in storage system is checked (and opportunity provided to correct input errors)

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.7-2.b-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a form which contains two select boxes, and a submit button.

    Changing the selection in the select boxes causes no screen change and triggers no validation. When the submit button is pressed, the form is validated.

    When entry is valid, the form disappears, a confirmation notification appears and receives focus. The confirmation notification says that a financial transaction has occured.

    When entry is invalid, an error notification appears on screen. The error notification is within a live region. The financial transaction does not occur until the user corrects the invalid entry.

    The system provides an opportunity to correct input errors.

    A successful test should identify a Pass against Baseline 10.7 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.7-ErrorPrevention

    **Test Instruction:** 2b

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them before the financial transaction occurs.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the

| IC-1 | Page that causes legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses. | Identifiy that the page causes a financial transaction for the user to occur that will modify user-controllable data in data storage systems. |
| 1 | Complete the form components necessary to submit. Include errors. | Pass: Fill out the form and create an input error (attempt to order zero pizzas). Press the submit button. |
| 2 | Check that at least one of the following is true [SC 3.3.4] <ol type="a"><li> Reversible: Submissions are reversible.</li><li> Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.</li><li> Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.</li></ol> | Pass: b. The system checks for input errors and provides the user an opportunity to correct them. |
