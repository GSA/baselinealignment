# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    Detect existence of audio descriptions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data does not include audio descriptions. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 17.5-ADPrerecorded.

| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.4-1** | Enable audio descriptions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with audio descriptions is provided, test that file. |  |
| **17.4-2** | Check that captions are provided. **Update to Baseline required to insert this instruction**| Pass |
| **17.4-3** | Check that captions are accurate and include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location. [SC 1.2.2] | Pass |
| **17.4-4** | Check that the captions do not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video. [SC 1.2.2] | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | PASS |
