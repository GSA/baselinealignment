title: Decorative Image - role equals none


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-2-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. Check if the aria role is "none", "presentation", the aria-hidden is set to true,
    the text alternative is empty, or if the image is inserted with CSS.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in a <code>role = "none"</code> attribute. Assistive Technologies should ignore the presence of the image, which is why a successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.
