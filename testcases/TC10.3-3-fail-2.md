tcid: TC10.3-3-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

| IC-1 | Identify the elements on the page. Enter input into the elements. Move focus away from the elements. Observe for context changes. | There are radio buttons on the page. |
| 1 | Enter data in all form fields, and exit (tab out of) the field. | Make radio button selections using a mouse or keyboard. Tab away from the radio buttons. |
| 2 | Change selections and/or values for form components, such as radio buttons, check boxes, select lists, etc. | Select each radio button in the group. |
| 3 | Check that navigating away from a component and/or changing component values/selections (e.g., entering data in a text field, changing a radio button selection) does NOT initiate a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component. `[`SC 3.2.2`]` Examples of a change of context could include: Forms submitted automatically when exiting the field, Forms submitted automatically when exiting the last field in a form, New windows launched when changing a radio button selection, Focus is changed to another component when a select list item is selected | Fail: Tabbing out of the fourth radio button unexpectedly changes the context by opening a new browser window or tab. |
