# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Insufficient contrast ratio for 18 point text

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC8.1-3-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample at 18 point font does not provide sufficient contrast between the foreground and background.


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: |
  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
    
  **Test Instruction:** 3


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample **DOES NOT** provide sufficient contrast (1.72:1) based on the text size (18 pt font), foreground color, and background color.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
|IC| All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | The sample code contains text that is 18 pt font |
| 8.1-1 | Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | The contrast ratio for the text is 1.72:1 | 
| 8.1-2 | Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 3.14] | **FAIL:** The contrast ratio is less than 3:1 (it is 1.72:1 ) |
| 8.1-3 | If the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1, check that the ratio is at least 3:1 AND the font meets one of the following criteria [SC 1.4.3]: At least 18 point (23.94 pixels); At least 14 point (18.62 pixels) AND bold (at least 700 font weight) | **FAIL:** The font is at least 18 point, but the contrast ratio is less than 3:1 (1.72:1) |
| Results | Both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-Contrast Minimum.  | **FAIL** - both checks fail |
