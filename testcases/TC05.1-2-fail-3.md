# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - state not accurate after change

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-2-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr:
The page has a functioning non-native checkbox which defaults to an unchecked state on page load.

The checkbox is a <code>div</code> element with <code>role="checkbox"</code> and <code>aria-checked="false"</code>.

When the checkbox is activated with a mouse click or spacebar key press, the checkbox visually appears to become checked. However, assistive technologies cannot programmatically determine the change of state because the <code>aria-checked</code> attribute is not updated to <code>true</code>.

A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline:
    [5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/05Changing.html#51-test-procedure-for-changes-in-content)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content

    **Test Instruction:** 2.c

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After content change, the programmatically determinable state of the element does not change.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Activate the checkbox using a mouse click or keyboard spacebar and observe for changes to content |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: Focus does not shift from the element that changed. |
| 2.c | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`] State: the state of the element is accurate after a change, if applicable. Evaluate ARIA and element-specific attributes. | Fail: The programmatically determinable state of the checkbox does not change to checked when the checkbox visually appears to be in the checked state. |
