# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 6.4 Images of Text - FAIL: image of text cannot be customized for font 


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC6.4-2-fail-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The code sample presents a page with an image of text that cannot be customized for font. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline Test 6.4 Images of Text.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.4 Test Procedure for Images of Text
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: FAIL since there is an image of text cannot be customized for font.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any images of text, except where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed (e.g., logotypes or text that is part of a logo or brand name).
| **6.4-1** | Check that using text cannot achieve the same visual presentation and effect as images of text. `[SC 1.4.5`] | Fail: using text could achieve the same visual presentation and effect. |
| **6.4-2** | Check that the image of text can be visually customized to a user's requirements. For example, web content allows users to specify font, size, color, and background settings, and all images of text are then provided based on those settings. `[SC 1.4.5`] | Fail: image of text cannot be customized for font. |
| FAIL; page has an image of text that cannot be customized for font. |
