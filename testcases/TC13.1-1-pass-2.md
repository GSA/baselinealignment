# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Descriptive Headings - with a one-word heading describing the purpose and/or topic of its contents


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.1-1-pass-2

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page or screen.

    The code sample provides a one word heading which describes the content accurately, which would cause Assistive Technologies to provide the correct topic for its content. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 13.1 Descriptive Headings.

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page or screen. |
| **13.1-1** | Check that each heading describes the topic or purpose of its content. | True |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 13.1-HeadingDescriptive fails. | PASS; the first check passed. |
