# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Controls - player on page, but it does not play synchronized media (only audio)


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1

    Detect existence of synchronized media player.

    The code sample does not contain synchronized media player. There is an audio player. A successful test should identify a Does Not Apply for Baseline 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls.

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: There is no synchronized media player in the code sample. There is only an audio player.
