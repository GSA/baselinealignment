# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Controls - player on page, but it does not play synchronized media (only audio)


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.1-ic-dna-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    Detect existence of synchronized media player.

    The code sample does not contain synchronized media player. There is an audio player. A successful test should identify a Does Not Apply for Baseline 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls
    
    **Test Instruction:** IC

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: There is no synchronized media player in the code sample. There is only an audio player.
