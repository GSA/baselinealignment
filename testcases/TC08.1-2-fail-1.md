# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Contrast - insufficient contrast ratio for small text


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC08.1-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect foreground text size and contrast ratio between foreground text and background. Determine wither contrast ratio is sufficient.

    The text in the code sample is small text and **DOES NOT** provide sufficient contrast with the background.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [8.1 TestTest Procedure for Contrast (minimum)](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/08Contrast.html)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample does not provide sufficient contrast based on the text size, foreground color, and background color.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
