# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Contrast - insufficient contrast ratio for small text


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC08.1-2-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect foreground text size and contrast ratio. Determine wither contrast ratio is sufficient.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [8.1 TestTest Procedure for Contrast (minimum)](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/08Contrast.html)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample does not provide sufficient contrast based on the text size, foreground color, and background color.

# URL for the code sample
# Upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder, then provide the link
# (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF08/08.1-2-fail-1.html

# Provide a snippet of the code below
code: |
 
    <body>
        <div style="margin:20px">
        <p style="color:aquamarine">This is some text with poor contrast</p>

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |

| **IC-1** |  Identify any `<img>` elements. | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. |
| **IC-1** | Determine whether the image is meaningful. Review the page content and image context to determine whether the image conveys meaningful information. | The image is meaningful, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1** | Calculate the accessible name and accessible description output for the image according to [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element). | The output for the accessible name and accessible description computations is `empty`. |
| **Result** | Determine whether any checks fail according to the `6. Images` test instructions. | The first check fails due to empty accessible name and/or description in the text alternative computation output. |
