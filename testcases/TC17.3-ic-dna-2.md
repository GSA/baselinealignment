# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Audio Description Control Level - media player does not play synchronized media (only audio)


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.3-ic-dna-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of a Media player that displays video with synchronized audio and has volume adjustment controls.

    The code sample does not contain synchronized media player. There is an audio player. A successful test should identify a Does Not Apply for Baseline 17.2-MediaPlayerCCLevel.
