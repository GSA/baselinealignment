# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Identification - item in error is not identified

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.4-2-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has two textboxes and a submit button. One textbox is labeled "Enter Anything" and the other is labeled "Enter A Number".

    When an non-numeric value is entered into the "Enter A Number" textbox and the user shifts focus away from the textbox or presses the submit button, then an error notification appears at the top of the screen. The error notification is contained within a live region.

    The error notification does not identify the input in error. The message is too generic.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 10.4 Error Identification.

| IC-1 | Input form components with automatic error detection and notification. | Identifiy that there are form components with automatic error detection and notification. |
| 1 | Enter incorrect values in input form components in order to trigger automatic error detection that results in error notifications. Examples include but are not limited to: required fields, date (format), state (abbreviations in an address), password | Pass: Entering incorrect values results in error notifications. |
| 2 | If an input error is automatically detected, check that the error notification meets all of the following [SC 3.3.1]. The user is made aware of the error (whether immediately upon shifting focus away from the item in error or when trying to submit the form), and the error is described to the user in text, and the item that is in error is identified in text. | Fail: The item in error is not identified in text. |
