# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: List - Visually apparent ordered list programmatically identified correctly


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.4-2-pass-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent ordered lists must be programatically identified with the correct list type. In the code sample included in this test case a visually apparent ordered list is correctly defined programatically with <ol>, an ordered list.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.4-List

    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The correct list type is used for the visually apparent list.

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent lists. For each list, determine if it appears to be ordered, unordered, or a description list. Ordered lists `<ol>` are numbered sequentially and, if necessary, hierarchically (e.g., 1, 2, 2a, 2ai, etc.) and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is important. Unordered lists `<ul>` are not numbered and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is not important. Description lists `<dl>` are used to group terms with their descriptions. | This code sample includes one visually apparent ordered list. | 
| **13.4-1** | Check that content that has the visual appearance of a list (with or without bullets) that has no special order or sequence is marked as an unordered list. [SC 1.3.1] | Not applicable |
| **13.4-2** | For each visually apparent list: Check that content that has the visual appearance of a numbered list is marked as an ordered list. [SC 1.3.1] | Pass - the visually apparent ordered list is correctly defined programatically as an ordered list. |
| **13.4-3** | Check that content is marked as a description list when terms and their descriptions are presented in the form of a list. [SC 1.3.1] | Not applicable |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, Baseline Test 13.4-List fails. | PASS |
