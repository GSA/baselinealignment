# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Audio Description (Prerecorded) - audio descriptions adequately describe all important visual content


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.5-all-pass-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of audio descriptions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data includes audio descriptions that adequately describe all important visual content. A successful test should identify a pass for Baseline 17.5-ADPrerecorded.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.5-1** | Enable audio descriptions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with audio descriptions is provided, test that file. | No result |
| **17.5-2** | Check that audio descriptions are provided **(Baseline update required to insert this instruction.)** | Pass |
| **17.5-3** | Check that the audio (with audio descriptions enabled) adequately describes important visual content in the media, including information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content. [SC 1.2.5] | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 17.5-ADPrerecorded fails. | PASS |
