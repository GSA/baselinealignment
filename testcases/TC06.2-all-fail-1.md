# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - non-descriptive text in accessible name and description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-all-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any image that is not pure decoration, is not used only for visual formatting, or is presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image with non-descriptive text in accessible name and description, which would cause Assistive Technologies to not ignore the image. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.2-DecorativeImage

    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict

result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample is an image with non-descriptive text in an accessible name and description.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys decoration | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is pure decoration. |

| **6.2-1** | Check to see that the ARIA role is "presentation". | Not applicable |
| **6.2-2** | Check to see that the ARIA role is "none". | Not applicable |
| **6.2-3** | Check to see that the aria-hidden is set to "true".| Not applicable |
| **6.2-4** | Check to see that the text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) is empty. | Not applicable |
| **6.2-5** | Check to see that the image is inserted via CSS. | Not applicable |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.2-DecorativeImage fails. | FAIL. |
