| **IC-1** | Visually apparent lists. For each list, determine if it appears to be ordered, unordered, or a description list. Ordered lists `<ol>` are numbered sequentially and, if necessary, hierarchically (e.g., 1, 2, 2a, 2ai, etc.) and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is important. Unordered lists `<ul>` are not numbered and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is not important. Description lists `<dl>` are used to group terms with their descriptions. | This code sample includes one visually apparent description list. | 
| **13.4-1** | For each visually apparent list: Check that content that has the visual appearance of a list (with or without bullets) that has no special order or sequence is marked as an unordered list. [SC 1.3.1] | Not applicable |
| **13.4-2** | For each visually apparent list: Check that content that has the visual appearance of a numbered list is marked as an ordered list. [SC 1.3.1] | Not applicable |
| **13.4-3** | Check that content is marked as a description list when terms and their descriptions are presented in the form of a list. [SC 1.3.1] | Pass - the visually apparent description list is correctly defined programatically. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, Baseline Test 13.4-List fails. | PASS |
