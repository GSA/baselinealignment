# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - with visually apparent headings with multiple heading levels identified using ARIA role=heading and appropriate ARIA-level attributes



# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-all-pass-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page or screen.

      The code sample provides a depiction of visually apparent headings with multiple heading levels formed using ARIA <code> role=heading </code> and appropriate ARIA-level attributes, which would cause Assistive Technologies to provide the correct heading corresponding to each section and the correct subheading corresponding to each subsection. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The visually apparent headings in the code sample contain multiple heading levels created using ARIA role=heading and appropriate ARIA-level attributes

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. |
| **13.2-1.a** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code> <h1 </code> is a higher level than <code> <h2> </code>, which is higher than <code> <h3> </code>| PASS
| **13.2-1.b** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. Check that headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. | PASS
| **13.2-1.c-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. Check to see that the headings in the code sample are defined programmatically. | PASS
| **13.2-1.c-2** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. HTML or ARIA programmatically identify each heading. When both are used, heading levels must match. | PASS
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | PASS |
