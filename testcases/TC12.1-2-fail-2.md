# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Data Table with role = "none"


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC12.2-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of ARIA table symantics ignored blah blah blah something like that.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [12.1 Test Procedure for Data Tables](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/12DataTables/#12-tables)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 12.1-DataTable
    
    **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: the table failed because role == none .. blah blah blah.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF12/12.1-2-fail-2.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result
#
# Include the table in the content section below

| **IC-1** | All content/data visually presented in a table with column and/or row headers where the content is not in a meaningful sequence when linearized. (Note: Linearization of table content is the presentation of a tableâ€™s two-dimensional content in one-dimensional order of the content in the source, beginning with the first cell in the first row and ending with the last cell in the last row, from left to right, top to bottom.) | One `<table>` exists in the test data code sample. Blah blah blah |
| **12.1-1** | Table: Check that each data table has programmatic markup to identify it as a table using one of the following techniques [SC 1.3.1]: HTML `<table>`; ARIA `role="table"`; ARIA `role="grid"` | Pass: The table is contained in a `<table>` element. | 
| **12.1-2** | Check that the data `<table>` element DOES NOT have `role="presentation"` or `role="none"`. [SC 1.3.1] | Fail: The data '<table>' element has `role="none"`. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 12.1-DataTable fails. | 12.1-2 check fails. |
