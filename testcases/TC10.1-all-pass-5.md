# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Form Names - accessible name via aria-labelledby attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.1-all-pass-5 #adapted from oldTestCases>TC10-006-pass

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the input element. The code sample data presents an aria-labelledby attribute that contributes to the accessible name output. A successful test should identify a passing implementation against Baseline Test 10.1 FormName.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [10.1 Test Procedure for Form Names](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#101-test-procedure-for-form-names)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.1-FormName
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The input element in the code sample provides an accessible name value via implementation of an aria-labelledby attribute.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, read-only fields, and multi-select lists. | One `<input>` element exists in the test data code sample. |
| **IC-2** | Find all instructions and cues (textual and graphical) that are related to form components, including groupings, order of completion, special conditions or qualifiers, format instructions, etc. | The `<input>` control has a visual prompt before the control. |
| **10.1-1** | Check that the combination of the accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | The output for the accessible name and accessible descriptions computations is populated via the aria-labelledby attribute. | 
| **10.1-2** | Check that the non-empty combination of the accessible name and accessible description and other programmatic associations (e.g., table column and/or row associations) describes each form component and includes all relevant instructions and cues (textual and graphical). [SC 1.3.1] | The accessible name "Company Name" describes the field with all relevant instructions. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 10.1-FormName fails. | Pass - all checks pass. |
