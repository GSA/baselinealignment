# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:

    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. Determine if the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute is correct for the language for the page. The value must also be identified in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's IANA Language subtag registry.

    The code sample provides a page in English with the language for the page incorrectly identified as French. A successful test should identify a FAIL for Baseline 15.1-LanguagePage.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 15.1-LanguagePage
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 1.3.1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The English page's <code>html</code> tag has <code>lang="fr"</code> which is not the correct value.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives).| Applicable; page has text. |
| **15.1-1** | Identify the default human language of the page by reviewing the page content. The default human language of the page is the language in which most of the content is presented. | Page language is English. | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the lang attribute is defined on the `<html>` tag for the page. [SC 3.1.1] | Pass: `<html lang="fr">` |
| **15.1-3** | Check that the value of the `lang` attribute matches the determined default human language for the page. [SC 3.1.1] | Fail: "en" is the correct language subtag for this English page |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | Fail: 15.1-3 fails |
