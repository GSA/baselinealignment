# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Audio-Only (Prerecorded) - Complete text transcript provided


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC16.1-all-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of a text transcript that desribes all audio-only content.

    The code sample contains audio-only content and a complete text transcript. A successful test should identify a Pass for Baseline 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded audio-only content. | There is audio-only content. |
| **16.1-1** | Check that the content provides transcript(s) for audio-only content. [SC 1.2.1] | Pass |
| **16.1-2** | Check that the transcript is text (i.e., an image of a transcript would not be sufficient to pass this test). | Pass. |
| **16.1-3** | Play the audio-only content entirely. | No result |
| **16.1-4** | Check that the information in the transcript is an accurate and complete representation of the audio-only content and includes relevant sounds in addition to dialogue, such as doors banging, sirens wailing, identification of speakers in dialogue, etc. [SC 1.2.1] | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript fails. | Pass |
