# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Form Names - accessible name from title attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.1-all-pass-3 #adapted from oldTestCases>TC10-004-pass

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative output for the image. Then determine whether the text alternative output for the image provides an equivalent description of the image. The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an aria-label attribute. A successful test should identify a passing implementation against Baseline Test 10.1 FormName.

    [10.1 Test Procedure for Form Names](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#101-test-procedure-for-form-names)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.1-FormName
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The input element in the code sample provides an accessible name value via implementation of a title attribute.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, read-only fields, and multi-select lists. | One `<input>` element exists in the test data code sample. |
| **IC-2** | Find all instructions and cues (textual and graphical) that are related to form components, including groupings, order of completion, special conditions or qualifiers, format instructions, etc. | The `<input>` control has a visual prompt before the control. |
| **10.1-1** | Check that the combination of the accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | The output for the accessible name and accessible descriptions computations is populated via the title attribute value. | 
| **10.1-2** | Check that the non-empty combination of the accessible name and accessible description and other programmatic associations (e.g., table column and/or row associations) describes each form component and includes all relevant instructions and cues (textual and graphical). [SC 1.3.1] | The accessible name "Last Name" describes the field with all relevant instructions. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 10.1-FormName fails. | Pass - all checks pass. |
