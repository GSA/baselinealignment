# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Descriptive Headings - with a visual heading that does not describe purpose or topic of its contents

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.1-1-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page or screen.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the headings not describing the purpose of the contents, which would cause Assistive Technologies to provide incorrect information to the user. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.1 - Descriptive Headings.

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page or screen. |
| **13.1-1** | Check that each heading describes the topic or purpose of its content. | False |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.1-HeadingDescriptive fails. | FAIL. |
