# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: changing Content - aria-live='off'

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC10.5-1-fail
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: fail

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    The code sample presents <code>aria-live='off'</code>. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 5.1-ChangeContent.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline: TC05.1-1-fail-1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]

    After content change, the text updated in the code sample is neither programatically bound, given focus, nor included in a live region.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
