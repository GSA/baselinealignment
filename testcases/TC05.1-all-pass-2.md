# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - notification of changed content in ARIA live region

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-all-pass-12

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a textbox with an associated label and is described by a date format. A save button is located below the input.

    After entering text in the field, when focus moves away from the textbox (a blur event is triggered) the entry will be validated against the format. If the entry is invalid, an error message appears above the field.

    The error message is located within an assertive live region. There is no programmatic shift in focus.

    A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Identify that there is a textbox. Enter an invalid date in the textbox. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: An error message appears on screen and is contained within a live region. |
| 2 | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` | Pass: The combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. |
