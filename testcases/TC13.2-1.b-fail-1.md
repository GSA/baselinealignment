# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - same heading level used for subsections and more major heading


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.b-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visual subheadings under a more major heading should have a lower programmatic level than the more major heading.

    The code sample provides visual subheadings below a major heading. The subheadings are programmatically the same level as the major heading but should be at a lower level. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

    [13.2 Test Procedure for Visual Headings](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/13Structure.html#132-test-procedure-for-visual-headings)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.2-VisHeadingProg

    **Test Instruction:** 1.b

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The visual headings in the code sample are all at the same level, but some should be at a lower level

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. |
| **13.2-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. | Pass: the visual headings are programmatically determinable, and the programmatic heading levels match the visual heading presentation. | 
| **13.2-1.a** | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code><h1></code> is a higher level than <code><h2></code>, which is higher than <code><h3></code>. | All headings are at the same level. |
| **13.2-1.b** | Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section.  | Fail: Headings at equal level start new subsection and should be at a lower level.
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.b fails |
