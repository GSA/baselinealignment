# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - with same heading level used for subsections, but styled to be smaller


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.b-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

    The code sample provides headings corresponding to each paragraph, but with each heading's font size smaller than the font of the paragraph. This would cause assistive technologies to identify each heading, but fail to account for the smaller font size in the headings. This demonstrates that the programmatic heading levels do not logically match the visual presentation in the heading structure. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. |
| **13.2-1.a** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code> <h1 </code> is a higher level than <code> <h2> </code>, which is higher than <code> <h3> </code>| Fail: the headings do not have the correct visual priority levels. |
| **13.2-1.b** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. Check that headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. | Fail: the subheadings of an equal or higher level do not start new sections.
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.b fails |
