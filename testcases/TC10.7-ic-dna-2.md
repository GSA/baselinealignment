# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Prevention - form field, but does no change to user-controllable data in storage system

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.7-ic-dna-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a form, but it does not cause a legal commitment, financial transactions, nor modifies/deletes user-controllable data in storage system

    A successful test should identify a DNA against Baseline 10.7 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The page does not change user-controllable data in a storage system, therefore this test procedure does not apply

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
