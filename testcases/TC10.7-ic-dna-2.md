# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Prevention - form field, but does not cause legal commitment, financial transactions, nor modifies/deletes user-controllable data in a storage system

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.7-ic-dna-2

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a form, but it does not cause a legal commitment, financial transactions, nor modifies/deletes user-controllable data in a storage system

    A successful test should identify a DNA against Baseline 10.7 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The page does not cause a legal commitment, financial transactions, nor modifies/deletes user-controllable data in a storage system, therefore this test procedure does not apply

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| IC-1 | Page that causes legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses. | DNA: Identifiy that the page has a form but does not cause legal commitments nor financial transactions nor modifies/deletes user-controllable data in a storage system. |
