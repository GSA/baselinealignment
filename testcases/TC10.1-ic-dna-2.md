# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Form Names - hidden input element (display:none)


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.1-ic-dna-2 #adapted from oldTestCases>TC10-009-dna

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The purpose of this test case is to detect attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for input elements. The input element in the code sample does not present itself via the Accessibility tree/Accessibility object model (AOM), visually, or programmatically and consequently cannot be identified by the tester within the current test process. Consequently, a successful test should indicate that this test does not apply to Baseline Test 10.1 FormName.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.1-FormName
    
    **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The input element in the code sample is hidden from visibility and from the accessibility tree; therefore there are no elements on the page that fit the Identify Content criteria.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF10/10.1-ic-dna-2.html

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, read-only fields, and multi-select lists. | The single input element in this test case is enclosed in a `<div>` element with the `display:none` style property, which removes it from the accessibility tree, visible, and programmatic detection. Even though the code exists in the DOM, this property renders the element undetectable and therefore not applicable to this Baseline Test based on the results of test step 1. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 10.1-FormName fails. | DNA - Test 10.1-FormName does not apply because there are no elements on the page (in the accessibility tree) that fit the Identify Content criteria.  |
