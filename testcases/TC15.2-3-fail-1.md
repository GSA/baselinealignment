# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:

    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute for text (part) that differs from the default human language of the page. Determine if the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute is correct for the language of the part. The value must also be identified in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's IANA Language subtag registry.

    The code sample provides a page in English with a part in French, with the language incorrectly identified as Spanish. A successful test should identify a FAIL for Baseline 15.2-LanguagePart.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 15.2-LanguagePart
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The French part has incorrect <code>lang="es"</code> attribute.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Text content that differs from the default human language of the page including alternative text for non-text content.| Applicable; page has French text on an English page. |
| **15.2-1** | Identify the human language of the text content that differs from the default human language of the page. | French | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the `lang` attribute is specified for any HTML element that contains a content segment that differs from the default human language of the page. [SC 3.1.2] | Pass: `<blockquote lang="es">` |
| **15.1-3** | Check that the value of the `lang` attribute is correctly defined for the content segment. [SC 3.1.2] | Fail: "es" is not the correct language subtag for French |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | Fail: 15.1-3 fails. |
