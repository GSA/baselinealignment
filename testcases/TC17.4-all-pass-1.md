# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of captions for the synchronized media.

    The code sample data includes captions that are complete, accurate, synchronized, and do not obscure other important on-screen text. A successful test should identify a pass against Baseline 17.4-CaptionsPrerecorded.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded synchronized multimedia. | One `<video>` exists in the test data code sample. The media has sound and visual information. |
| **17.4-1** | Enable captions through multimedia player functions and play the media. If a separate media file with captions is provided, test that file. | Captions enabled |
| **17.4-2** | Check that captions are provided. **Update to Baseline required to insert this instruction**| Pass |
| **17.4-3** | Check that captions are accurate and include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location. [SC 1.2.2] | Pass |
| **17.4-3a** | Listen to the audio of the entire synchronized media. | No result |
| **17.4-3b** | Compare the audio to the captions for accuracy, time-synchronization, and equivalence. | Pass |
| **17.4-4** | Check that the captions do not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video. [SC 1.2.2] | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | PASS |
