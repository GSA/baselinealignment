# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 13.3 Programmatic Headings Visual - DNA: no programmatic headings 


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.3-ic-dna-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The code sample presents a page with no programmatic headings. A successful test should identify a DNA against Baseline Test 13.3 Programmatic Headings Visual.
