# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Link Purpose (In Context) - Page with no links

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC14.1-ic-dna-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

 **Baseline Test ID:** 14.1-LinkPurpose
 
 **Test Instruction:** Identify Content

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: DNA

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample shows that there are no links present.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

# Include the table in the content section below

| IC-1 | All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.| The sample code does not contain any links. |
| Result | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. No links are present. | DNA - the page has no links. |
