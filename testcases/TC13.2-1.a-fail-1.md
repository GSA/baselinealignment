| IC-1 | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | Visually, there are four headings on the page that appear with top-level heading at the top of the page, with subsequent lower-level headings just below, and another top-level heading toward the bottom of the page. |
| 1 | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure `[`SC 1.3.1`]`: | Fail: All visual heading levels are programmatically defined, but programmatically defined heading levels do not matcth the visual presentation of headings |
| 1.a | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <h1> is a higher level than <h2>, which is higher than <h3>. | Fail: The first heading on the page is an `<`h4`>` element, but it uses inline style to increase the font size and the heading appears as an `<`h1`>` element. |
| Result | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails | 13.2 Fails |
