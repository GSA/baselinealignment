# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - with heading levels not matching visual hierarchy

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.a-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

    The code sample provides a code sample containing headings with mismatched visual hierarchies. For example, in the code sample, there is the heading <code> <h3 style="font-size: 120%;"> Baroque Period - 1600 to 1750 </h3> </code> and <code> <h4 style="font-size:50%;"> Classical Period - 1750 to 1830</h4> </code>. Since the third heading and fourth heading are not the same font size, assistive technologies would be unable to correctly distinguish headings from one another. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. |
| **13.2-1.a** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]. The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code> <h1 </code> is a higher level than <code> <h2> </code>, which is higher than <code> <h3> </code>| Fail: the headings do not have the correct visual priority levels. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1.a fails |
