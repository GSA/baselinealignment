# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visual Headings - most important heading does not have the higher priority level programmatically

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.2-1.a-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, &lt;h1&gt; is a higher level than &lt;h2&gt;, which is higher than &lt;h3&gt;.

    The code sample provides visual headings that appear to be at three levels. Programmatically, the &lt;h4&gt; is a higher level heading but its subheadings are &lt;h3&gt;. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 13.2 Visual Headings.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.2-VisHeadingProg

    **Test Instruction:** 1.a

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 1.3.1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The visual heading has a lower programmatic heading level than its subheadings in the code samples .

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **13.2-IC** | Visually apparent headings, which denote sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page. | Visual apparent headings found. |
| **13.2-1** | Check that all visual headings are programmatically determinable and that programmatic heading levels logically match the visual heading presentation within the heading structure [SC 1.3.1]: |  | 
| **13.2-1.a** | The most important heading(s) should have the highest priority level. For example, <code><h1></code> is a higher level than <code><h2></code>, which is higher than <code><h3></code>. | Fail: <code><h4> Periods of Classical Music </h4></code> should be higher than its <code><h3></code> subheadings. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 13.2-VisHeadingProg fails. | FAIL; 13.2-1a fails |
