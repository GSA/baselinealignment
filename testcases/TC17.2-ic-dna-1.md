# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Caption Control Level - no synchronized media on page


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.2-ic-dna-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

    Detect existence of synchronized media player.

    The code sample does not contain synchronized media player. A successful test should identify a Does Not Apply for Baseline 17.2-MediaPlayerCCLevel.
