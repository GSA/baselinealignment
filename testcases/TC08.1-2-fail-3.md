# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Contrast - Insufficient contrast ratio for small text, when color changes on hover/focus

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC8.1-2-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT

# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample provides sufficient contrast between the foreground and background in its initial state; however, the color of the heading changes on hover, which does not provide sufficient contrast ratio (2.32:1) between the text and the background.

  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-Contrast
    
  **Test Instruction:** 1


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground and background text and size contrast ratio in the code sample provide sufficient contrast in the initial state of the text; however, the color of the heading changes on hover, which does not provide sufficient contrast ratio (2.32:1) between the text and the background.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Identify Content | All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | The page contains text that is 15 point, bold font |
| 8.1-1| Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | The contrast ratio for the text in its initial state is 21:1; the contrast of the text on hover is 2.32:1 | 
| 8.1-2| Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 3.14] | **FAIL:** The contrast ratio of the text on hover is less than 4.5:1 (it is 2.32:1) |
| 8.1-3| If the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1, check that the ratio is at least 3:1 AND the font meets one of the following criteria [SC 1.4.3]: At least 18 point (23.94 pixels); At least 14 point (18.62 pixels) AND bold (at least 700 font weight) | **FAIL:** While the text is 15 point, bold font, the text on hover is less than 3:1 (it is 2.32:1) |
| Test Results | Both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-Contrast Minimum.  | **FAIL:** Both checks fail |
