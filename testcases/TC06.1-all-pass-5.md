title: Meaningful Image - text equivalent in aria-described by attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image. Then determine whether the text alternative output for the image provides an equivalent description of the image.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.1 Meaningful Images.

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample has a descriptive accessible name from its <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.) | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1-1** | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's non-empty accessible name from `aria-describedby` is "Bland Corp. logo". |
| **6.1-2** | Check that the non-empty text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) provides an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. Refer to HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's accessible name "Bland Corp. logo" is an equivalent description. |
| **6.1-2a** | Descriptions of the image that are provided by page content must be programmatically associated. | Not applicable |
| **6.1-2b** | When an image is updated to convey a new meaning, check that its text alternative is updated at the same time. [SCs 1.1.1 and 4.1.2] | Not applicable  |
| **6.1-3** | Check that the ARIA role is NOT "presentation".| Pass |
| **6.1-4** | Check that the ARIA role is NOT "none". | Pass |
| **6.1-5** | Check that aria-hidden is NOT set to "true". | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | All checks PASS (or do not apply). |
