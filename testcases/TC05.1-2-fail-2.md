# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Changing Content - role not accurate after change

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC05.1-2-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr:
The page has five buttons below a question.

When a button is activated, content is revealed. The content consists of a new question and what appears to be a textbox. When the content is revelead, focus is placed within the textbox.

Upon examining the textbox element markup, a tester will discover that the element does not have an accurate role that describes the purpose of the element.

The textbox element is a <code>div</code> element with <code>contenteditable</code> attribute and no <code>role</code> attribute. The element has an <code>aria-label</code> with a value of "Because" which is also not descriptive of the element's role.

A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 5.1 Changing Content.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline:
    [5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/05Changing.html#51-test-procedure-for-changes-in-content)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 5.1 Test Procedure for Changes in Content

    **Test Instruction:** 2.b

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After the revealed content appears, the role of one of the elements does not accurately describe the purpose of the element.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF05/05.1-2-fail-2.html

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1 | Identify changes in presented content (both user driven and automatic). Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc.
It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover or on click.
Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc. | Activate a button and observe for changes to content. |
| 1 | Check that the page provides a notification of the change in content programmatically. `[`SC 4.1.2`]`
Programmatic event notifications include alert dialogs, focus shifts to the content that changed, and ARIA live regions. | Pass: Focus moves to the first focusable element within the revealed content. |
| 2.b | For each change in content, check that the combination of name, role, state, and value of the changed content is accurate. `[`SC 4.1.2`]` Role: the role accurately describes the purpose of the element after a change, if applicable.
Consider ARIA role, element type, and other descriptive text. | Fail: An element appears on screen and functions like a textbox but does not have a programmatically defined role such as "textbox". |
