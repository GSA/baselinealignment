# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Page Titles - no <title> element


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC11.1-1-fail-1


# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. This test evaluates the presence of the <title> element on the Web page.

    The code sample presents a page with no <title> element. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 11.1 Test Procedure for Page Titled
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: No <title> element is defined for the page.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| **IC-1** | Pages with text (including text alternatives) (note: proposed change to baseline).| Applicable; page is an HTML web page with text. |
| **11.1** | Check that a page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined for the page. `[SC 2.4.2`] | Fail: No <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is defined | 
| **Result** | If the above check fails, then Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled fails. | Fail: 11.1-1 check fails. |
