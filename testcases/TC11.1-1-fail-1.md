    The `<title>` element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. This test evaluates the presence of the `<title>` element on the Web page.

    The code sample presents a page with no `<title>` element. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline Test 11.1-PageTitled.
