# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Visually apparent unordered list not identified as a list programmatically


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.4-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Visually apparent lists must also provide indication programatically that the informaton is included in a list. In the code sample included in this test case a visually apparent list is not defined as a list programatically. 

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    **Baseline Test ID:** 13.4-List

    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Because the information presented visually in a list is not defined as a list programatically the content fails baseline test 13.4.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder

| **IC-1** | Visually apparent lists. For each list, determine if it appears to be ordered, unordered, or a description list. Ordered lists `<ol>` are numbered sequentially and, if necessary, hierarchically (e.g., 1, 2, 2a, 2ai, etc.) and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is important. Unordered lists `<ul>` are not numbered and are used where sequence or the ability to reference specific items by number/letter is not important. Description lists `<dl>` are used to group terms with their descriptions. | This code sample includes one visually apparent unordered list. | 
| **13.4-1** | For each visually apparent list: Check that content that has the visual appearance of a list (with or without bullets) that has no special order or sequence is marked as an unordered list. [SC 1.3.1] | Fail - the visually apparent list is not defined programatically as a list. |
| **Result** | If the above check fails, Baseline Test 13.4-List fails. | FAIL; the check fails. |
