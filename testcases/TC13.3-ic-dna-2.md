# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Programmatic Heading - visually apparent headings but no programmatic headings
# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC13.3-ic-dna-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Programmatic headings should only be used on visual headings, which denote sections of content. 

    The code sample provides visual headings but no programmatic headings. A successful test should identify a DOES NOT APPLY against Baseline 13.3-ProgHeadingVisual.
