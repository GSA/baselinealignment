title: Link Purpose(In Context) - link has an accessible name/description that is not sufficiently description of the link  (TC14.1-2-fail-1)

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:

  ** Baseline Test ID:** 14.1-LinkPurpose
 
  ** Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample shows that there is a link that does not have an accessible or descriptive name.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
