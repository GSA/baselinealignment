# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Link Purpose (In Context) - Image/link has an empty accessible name and description (TC14.1-1-fail-1)

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC14.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: The sample code inlcudes an iamge/link with an empty accessible name and description. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 14.1-LinkPurpose 


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample includes an image/link with no accessible name or description.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1 | All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.| The sample code includes one link on the page. |
| 14.1-1 | Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | FAIL - the image/link does not provide any alternative text for the image nor any other content or attributes that contribute to the accessible name or description | 
| Result | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. No accessible name or description. | FAIL - the image/link fails the check for non-empty accessible name and description. |
