# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Identification - error identified and described in alert dialog

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.4-all-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page contains a textbox, a label for the textbox, and a button.

    When the user enters text into the textbox and presses the button, the entry will be validated and an alert dialog will appear notifying the user whether the entry was valid or invalid.

    A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 10.4 Error Identification.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [10.4 Test Procedure for Error Identification](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#104-test-procedure-for-error-identification)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.4-ErrorIdentification

    **Test Instruction:** all

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: An error is automatically detected and the error notification meets all requirements of 10.4

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/TF10/TC10.4-all-pass-1.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers:
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1 | Input form components with automatic error detection and notification. | Identifiy that there are form components with automatic error detection and notification. |
| 1 | Enter incorrect values in input form components in order to trigger automatic error detection that results in error notifications. Examples include but are not limited to: required fields, date (format), state (abbreviations in an address), password | Pass: Entering incorrect values results in error notifications. |
| 2 | If an input error is automatically detected, check that the error notification meets all of the following [SC 3.3.1]. The user is made aware of the error (whether immediately upon shifting focus away from the item in error or when trying to submit the form), and the error is described to the user in text, and the item that is in error is identified in text. | Pass: An alert dialog is displayed which includes a text description of the error and references the item in error. |
