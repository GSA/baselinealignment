# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Data table (td) element in a table also includes role = "cell"

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC12.1-3-fail-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Using ARIA table semantics that overlap native table structural semantics can create confusion and conflict for both browsers and assistive technologies. The table in the sample code includes a data cell that also defines an ARIA role that overlaps structural semantics. 

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
  [12.1 Test Procedure for Data Tables](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/12DataTables/#12-tables)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 12.1-DataTable

  **Test Instruction:** 3

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 1.3.1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The table fails the baseline test because a data cell also includes an ARIA role with table structure semantics, 'role = "cell"'.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| **IC-1** | All content/data visually presented in a table with column and/or row headers where the content is not in a meaningful sequence when linearized. (Note: Linearization of table content is the presentation of a tableâ€™s two-dimensional content in one-dimensional order of the content in the source, beginning with the first cell in the first row and ending with the last cell in the last row, from left to right, top to bottom.) | One data `<table>` exists in the code sample. |
| **12.1-1** | Table: Check that each data table has programmatic markup to identify it as a table using one of the following techniques [SC 1.3.1]: HTML `<table>`; ARIA `role="table"`; ARIA `role="grid"` | Pass: The table is contained in a `<table>` element. | 
| **12.1-2** | Check that the data `<table>` element DOES NOT have `role="presentation"` or `role="none"`. [SC 1.3.1] | Pass: The data `<table>` element does not have `role="none"` nor `role="presentation"`. |
| **12.1-3** | Check that each data cell uses only one of the following methods to identify it as a data cell within a table row depending on the technique identified in the first step [SC 1.3.1]: For HTML `<table>: <td>` for the cell, which must be within a `<tr>`; row.; For ARIA `role="table"`: ARIA 'role="cell"', which must be within an ARIA 'role="row"'.; For ARIA role="grid": ARIA `role="gridcell"`, which must be within an ARIA `role="row"` (if the ARIA grid is not making use of the native HTML `<table>` element and structure). | Fail: Two data cells use more than one of the specified techniques: Those `<td>` cells also include `role="cell"`. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 12.1-DataTable fails. | 12.1-3 check fails. |
