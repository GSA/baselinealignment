# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Error Prevention - form that results in a financial transaction is confirmed before final submission

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.7-2.c-pass-1

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    The page has a form, which contains two select boxes and a submit button.

    Changing the selection in the select boxes causes no screen change and triggers no validation. When the button is pressed, the form disappears and a mechanism to review and confirm the entries appears and receives focus.

    Once reviewed, the page has a button which allows the user to return to the form to change the entries and a button to finalize the submission.

    When the submission is finalized, the review information dissapears, and a confirmation notification appears and receives focus. The confirmation notification says that a financial transaction has occured.

    A successful test should identify a Pass against Baseline 10.7 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)
