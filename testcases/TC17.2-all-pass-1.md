# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.2-all-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect control for captions and if it is at the same level as volume control for the synchronized media player.

    The code sample contains caption controls at the same level as volume controls for synchronized media player. A successful test should identify a pass for Baseline 17.2-MediaPlayerCCLevel.
