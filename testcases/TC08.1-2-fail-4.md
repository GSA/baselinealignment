# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Insufficient contrast ratio for small text in an image of text

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC8.1-2-fail-4

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: Detect the foreground and background text and size contrast ratio. Determine whether contrast ratio is sufficient. The text in the code sample does not provide sufficient contrast between the foreground and background.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
    
  **Test Instruction:** 2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground and background text and size contrast ratio in the code sample does not provide sufficient contrast in an image of text.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| IC-1 | All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | The sample code contains an image of meaningful text. |
| 8.1-1| Determine the contrast ratio of foreground and background in the image of text. | The contrast ratio for a portion of the text in the image is 2.8:1. | 
| 8.1-2| Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. (SC 3.1.4) | Fail - The contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1 (it is 2.8:1) |
| Results | Both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-Contrast Minimum.  | Fail - one of the checks fails for minimum contrast ratio for an image in  |
