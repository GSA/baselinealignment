# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Controls - controls for captions, but not for audio descriptions


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.1-1-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of controls for captions and audio description for the synchronized media player.

    The code sample contains caption controls but no audio description controls for synchronized media player. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The media player has no control for audio description.
