# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - with aria-hidden equals true


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-3-pass-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. Check if the aria role is "none", "presentation", the aria-hidden is set to true,
    the text alternative is empty, or if the image is inserted with CSS.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in a <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> attribute, which would cause Assistive Technologies to ignore the image. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. |

| | Check that at least one of the following is true [SC 1.1.1]: | |

| **6.2-2** | The ARIA role is "none". | False |
| **6.2-3** | Check to see that the aria-hidden is set to "true".| True |
