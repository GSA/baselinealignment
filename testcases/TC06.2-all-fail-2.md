# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - with non-descriptive text in accessible name and description


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-all-fail-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any image that is not pure decoration, is not used only for visual formatting, or is presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image containing non descriptive text in accessible name and description, which would cause Assistive Technologies to not ignore the image. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** |  Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. |

| **6.2-1** | The ARIA role is "presentation". | False |
