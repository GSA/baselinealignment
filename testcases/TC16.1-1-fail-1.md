# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: No transcript provided for audio-only content


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC16.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of a transcript for audio-only content.

    The code sample contains no transcript for audio-only content. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: There is no transcript for audio-only content.

| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded audio-only content. | There is audio-only content. |
| **16.1-1** | Check that the content provides transcript(s) for audio-only content. [SC 1.2.1] | Fail; no transcript |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript fails. | Fail |
