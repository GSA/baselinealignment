title: No transcript provided for audio-only content


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test

    Detect existence of a transcript for audio-only content.

    The code sample contains no transcript for audio-only content. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript.

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Pre-recorded audio-only content. | There is audio-only content. |
| **16.1-1** | Check that the content provides transcript(s) for audio-only content. [SC 1.2.1] | Fail; no transcript |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 16.1-AudioOnlyTranscript fails. | Fail |
