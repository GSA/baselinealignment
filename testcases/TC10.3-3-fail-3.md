# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: On Input - focus moved to unexpected component after select list item is selected

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.3-3-fail-3

version: 1.0

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    The page has a select box and a button.

    When the select box value is changed, focus is shifted to the button.

    A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 10.3 On Input.

    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Related standard (Section 508 or WCAG SC), referenced in each Baseline procedure/step
standard: WCAG
standard-ref: 3.2.2

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: After input, there are unexpected changes to context

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the

| IC-1 | Identify the elements on the page. Enter input into the elements. Move focus away from the elements. Observe for context changes. | There is a select box item on the page. |
| 1 | Enter data in all form fields, and exit (tab out of) the field. | Make a selection in the select box using a mouse or keyboard. |
| 2 | Change selections and/or values for form components, such as radio buttons, check boxes, select lists, etc. | Change the selection of the select box using a mouse or keyboard. |
| 3 | Check that navigating away from a component and/or changing component values/selections (e.g., entering data in a text field, changing a radio button selection) does NOT initiate a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component. `[`SC 3.2.2`]` Examples of a change of context could include: Forms submitted automatically when exiting the field, Forms submitted automatically when exiting the last field in a form, New windows launched when changing a radio button selection, Focus is changed to another component when a select list item is selected | Fail: Changing the selection in the select box immediately moves focus to the button element. |
