# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Link - purpose of each link can be determined from the link text

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid:TC14.1-pass-1
# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr:Detect the existence of a <link> tag and determine if the link text is descriptive of its purpose. The code sample provides a link that describes it intent. 
A successful test should identify a PASS for Baseline 14.1-Links.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-basline:|[14.1 Test Procedure for Link Purpose (In Context)]https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/14Links.html#141-test-procedure-for-link-purpose-in-context

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result:Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample describes the purpose of the link.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1|All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.|
| 14.1-1 | Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | Pass |
| 14.1-2 | Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from any combination of the link text, accessible name and accessible description, and preceding page context (same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link). [SC 2.4.4] | Pass |
| Result | If any of the above checks passes, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. | Pass |
