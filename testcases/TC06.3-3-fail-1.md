| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC | Identify any images of text, except where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed (e.g., logotypes or text that is part of a logo or brand name). | There are images of text present in a CAPTCHA test |
| 6.3-1 | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. `[`SC 1.1.1`]` | The text alternative is not empty |
| 6.3-2 | Check that the non-empty text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) identify and describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA. `[`SC 1.1.1`]` | The text alternative identifies that the image is a CAPTCHA test |
| 6.3-3 | Check that alternative forms of CAPTCHA are provided, at a minimum, for users without vision and users without hearing. `[`SC 1.1.1`]` | FAIL: An alternative form of CAPTCHA is not provided for users without vision. |
| Test Results | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.3-Captcha fails. | FAILL: An alternative form of CAPTCHA is not provided for users without vision. |
