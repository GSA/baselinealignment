# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - no decorative images


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-all-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any image that is not pure decoration, is not used only for visual formatting, or is presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of no decorative images, which would cause Assistive Technologies to not ignore the image. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    [6.2 Test Procedure for Meaningful Images](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/06Images.html#62-test-procedure-for-decorative-images)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.2-DecorativeImage

    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample has no decorative images.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.

# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys decoration | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is pure decoration. |

| **6.2-1** | Check to see that the ARIA role is "presentation". | Not applicable |
| **6.2-2** | Check to see that the ARIA role is "none". | Not applicable |
| **6.2-3** | Check to see that the aria-hidden is set to "true".| Not applicable |
