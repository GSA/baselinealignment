# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: testcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Decorative Image - with descriptive text in accessible name


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern:
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.2-all-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: |
    Identify any image that is not pure decoration, is not used only for visual formatting, or is presented to users.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of an image with descriptive text in accessible name, which would cause Assistive Technologies to not ignore the image. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 6.2 Decorative Images.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.2-DecorativeImage

    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample has an image with descriptive text in accessible name.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** |  Identify any decorative image that is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users. |
| **6.2-1** | The ARIA role is "presentation". | False |
| **6.2-2** | The ARIA role is "none". | False |
| **6.2-3** | The aria-hidden is set to "true".| False |
| **6.2-4** | The text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) is empty. | False |
| **6.2-5** | The image is inserted via CSS. | False |
| **Result** | If all of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.2-DecorativeImage fails. | FAIL. |
