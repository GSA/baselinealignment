# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: 3:1 contrast ratio for 14 point, bold font

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC8.1-3-pass-2

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: Determine size and weight of the text. Determine whether contrast ratio between foreground text and background is sufficient. The text in the code sample provides sufficient contrast (at least 3:1 for 14 point, bolded text) between the foreground and background.


# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: |
  [8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast Minimum](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/08Contrast/#81-test-procedure-for-contrast-minimum)

  **Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
    
  **Test Instruction:** 3


# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Pass

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The foreground text in the code sample provides sufficient contrast based on the text size and weight.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC | All visible text AND images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above) | The sample code contains text that is bold and at least 14 pt font (19px) |  
| 8.1-1 | Determine the contrast ratio of foreground text and background. | Contrast ratio is 4:1 |
| 8.1-2 | Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 1.4.3] | Fail - the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1 | 
| 8.1-3 | If the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1, check that the ratio is at least 3:1 AND the font meets one of the following criteria: [SC 1.4.3]: At least 18 point (23.94 pixels); At least 14 point (18.62 pixels) AND bold (at least 700 font weight) [SC 1.4.3] | Pass - the conrast ratio is greater than 3:1, and the text is at least 14 point AND bold |
| Results | If both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-ContrastMinimum fails. | Pass - the text in the sample code passes one of the checks in Baseline 8.1-ContrastMinimum|
