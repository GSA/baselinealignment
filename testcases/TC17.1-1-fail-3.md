# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
title: Media Player Controls - controls for audio descriptions, but not for captions


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC17.1-1-fail-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
descr: | 
    Detect existence of controls for captions and audio description for the synchronized media player.

    The code sample contains audio description controls but no caption controls for synchronized media player. A successful test should identify a fail for Baseline 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls.

    **Baseline Test ID:** 17.1-MediaPlayerCCADControls
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The media player has no control for captions.

| **IC-1** | Media player that displays video with synchronized audio. | There is a media player. |
| **17.1-1** | Check that user controls for the selection of captions and audio descriptions are provided. [Section 508 503.4] | Fail, no control for captions |
